## 📄 Project Overview
**SRIMS** is an **Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS)** designed to assist retail managers in making data-driven decisions. The system analyzes historical sales data to predict inventory needs, segment customers, and analyze market trends using advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques.

This project was developed as a requirement for the **Decision Support Systems** course.

## 🚀 Key Features (DSS Modules)

The system integrates **5 distinct AI Models** to support decision-making:

1.  **📈 Sales Volume Prediction (Prediction):**
    * *Algorithm:* Linear Regression
    * *Goal:* Predicts total sales amount based on unit price and quantity.
2.  **📅 Seasonal Demand Forecasting (Forecasting):**
    * *Algorithm:* ARIMA (Time Series Analysis)
    * *Goal:* Forecasts future monthly sales trends to optimize stock levels.
3.  **👥 Customer Classification (Classification):**
    * *Algorithm:* Decision Tree / Random Forest
    * *Goal:* Classifies customers into categories based on demographics.
4.  **🧩 Customer Segmentation (Clustering):**
    * *Algorithm:* K-Means Clustering
    * *Goal:* Groups customers by spending behavior (e.g., High Spenders vs. Casuals).
5.  **💬 Feedback Analysis (NLP):**
    * *Algorithm:* Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob/NLTK)
    * *Goal:* Analyzes customer reviews to gauge product satisfaction.
